Welcome to my System Design Repository ‚Äì a structured guide covering everything from foundations to Low-Level Design (LLD), High-Level Design (HLD), and advanced concepts.

This repo is built to help developers (including myself) master system design step by step, preparing for FAANG interviews, scalable architecture discussions, and real-world engineering.

# üìö Contents
## 1. Foundations

* Basics of System Design

* Client-Server Model

* Networking Essentials (HTTP, TCP, DNS, etc.)

* Caching Fundamentals

* Load Balancing Basics

* Database Concepts (SQL vs NoSQL, Sharding, Replication, Indexing)

## 2. Low-Level Design (LLD)

* Object-Oriented Design Principles (SOLID, DRY, etc.)

* Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton, Observer, Strategy, etc.)

* UML Diagrams (Class, Sequence, Activity)

* LLD Case Studies (Parking Lot, Splitwise, Elevator, etc.)

## 3. High-Level Design (HLD)

* Scalability Principles

* CAP Theorem & Consistency Models

* Microservices vs Monoliths

* Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)

* Caching Strategies (Redis, Memcached)

* HLD Case Studies (Twitter, Netflix, WhatsApp, Uber, Instagram, etc.)

## 4. Advanced Topics

* Distributed Systems Deep Dive

* Consensus Algorithms (Raft, Paxos)

* Event-Driven Architectures

* API Gateways & Rate Limiting

* CDNs & Edge Computing

* Real-world trade-offs and design decisions

# üöÄ Why this Repo?

* Structured Learning Path ‚Äì from beginner to advanced

* Interview Prep ‚Äì covers both LLD and HLD, aligned with FAANG-style questions

* Real-World Systems ‚Äì practical insights into designing scalable products

* Reference Hub ‚Äì a go-to place for quick revision before interviews or projects

# üõ†Ô∏è How to Use This Repo

* Start with Foundations if you‚Äôre new to system design

* Move to LLD for object-oriented design practice

* Explore HLD for large-scale distributed system concepts

* Dive into Advanced when you‚Äôre comfortable with fundamentals
