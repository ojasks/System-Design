SOLID principles.
**********************************************************************************************************
1st topic of LLD roadmap


S- single responsibilty principle
O- open/closed principle
L- Liskov substitution principle
I- interface segregation principle
D- dependency inversion principle

main goal -> to make code readable and reusable
no tight coupling
code resilience (the ability to work again after a failure)


* S- one class should only have one reason/responsibility to change. 
* O- code should be open for extension but closed for modification.
* L- subclasses should be replaceable with their parent classes without affecting applications correctness
* I- a class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does'nt use
* D- high level modules should not depend on low level modules. both should depend on abstractions
